Processing is a combinded set of java libraries and development environment created at MIT in 2001

It is based on Java (and in fact any Java code will work in Processing) and it also incorporates
a lot of OpenGL functionality.

You can read about Java here: http://www.java.com/en/about/

and OpenGL here: http://www.opengl.org/about/
and read a recent article about it here: http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/133824-valve-opengl-is-faster-than-directx-even-on-windows

/* You'll have noticed that the text above starts with /* and ends with */
/* This is one of the ways that we write comments in Processing (and Java, C, C++, etc...) */

// Another way that we can write comments is using a double forward slash at the start of a line
// If we use this method then we need to put // at the start of each line

// So:

/* Is often used when you want a
   multi-line comment */
   
// Is used for single line comments

// Comments are there to provide information about the code to a human who is reading it. Computers ignore comments when they 
// run programs. Comments will have no effect on the way a program runs. At all.
